# Connect 4 Project

## Overview
For project #1, I created a game of Connect 4.

Once players come to the site, they are asked to input their names. The first player starts by placing a black circle in a column. They then alternate placing black circles and pink circles on the game board until either player has four in a row or all circles are filled. Once a player wins, their score increases. When there is a tie, no one gets a point. The game allows players to play multiple games and clears the board.
